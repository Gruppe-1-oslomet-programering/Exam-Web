            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>Welcome!</h3>
            <p>
                The teachers and teaching assistants (TAs) welcome you to the Canvas site for the course Technology
                and
                Society for Programmers!
            </p>
            <p>
                This is an online course where modules will be published weekly. We would like to emphasize that
                changes
                might occur, but if they do, you will be notified of any changes through the Announcements page in
                the
                menu
                on the left side, therefore we highly recommend you keep an eye on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                There will be two live lectures in this course. They will both take place in week 34. They will
                cover
                the
                same topic, but one will be digital and one will be physical. You can choose which one you want to
                attend.
            </p>
            <p>
                Good luck with the course!

            <h3>Course Description:</h3>
            <p>
                Digital competence is a key factor in ensuring the employability of candidates in all professions
                vital
                to
                our society. This course will provide a fundamental understanding of our digital world. It gives an
                overview
                of how technology affects our lives and the way we work, as well as our social structures, work
                patterns
                and
                individual preferences contributing to shaping technology. Social media, digital governance, and
                eHealth
                are
                all examples of how technology has profoundly changed our everyday lives in the last few decades. An
                understanding of the benefits and limitations of technology is vital in any profession, regardless
                of
                field
                or speciality. In this course, students will acquire the basic knowledge required to harness the
                potential
                of technology and recognise its limitations and potentially harmful consequences on work and
                society.
                They
                will learn to identify the opportunities to use technology to foster inclusion and participation in
                an
                increasingly diverse and multicultural society. They will practice communicating orally the concepts
                they
                acquire in a structured manner.

            <h3>Course structure:</h3>
            <p>
                The course consists of eight thematic modules. Each module has an introduction video followed by
                videos that
                explore different aspects of the moduleâ€™s theme. To turn on the captions, click CC on the menu line.
                Some
                videos will present concepts and theoretical perspectives and others will present cases - such as an
                example
                of how a specific technology is being used in a profession. The modules will be published weekly,
                and there
                are eight modules in total (0-7).
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
                Regarding the labs, there are both physical and digital labs. You should only show up to one lab
                each week,
                and we suggest you use this time to work on the obligatory assignments with your group, or study the
                material you find on canvas. There will be no labs in week 34.

            <h4>Obligatory assignments</h4>
            <p>
                The students will have to pass five assignments in this course to qualify for the exam. There will
                be nine
                possible assignments to choose from. The first is innovation camp, which will take place during the
                introduction week. The second is an innovation workshop focused on the protection of privacy in the
                smart
                household which will be held by Cristina in September. We will provide more information about the
                workshop
                when we get closer to the date. The last seven assignments will correspond to modules one through
                seven and
                will be published along with their respective modules.
            </p>
            <p>
                The students will work in groups consisting of 3-4 people and the groups will have to stay the same
                throughout the semester. The students will have to self-assign to a group here on Canvas by
                September 16,
                23:59. You will find the groups under the People page in the menu on the left side, select "Project
                Group"
                and get all of your group members to assign themselves to the same group.

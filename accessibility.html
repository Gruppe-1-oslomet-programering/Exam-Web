                <h1>Accessibility</h1>
                <p> To test our code we used the WAVE evaluation tool, toptal's color filter tool, W3's CSS and HTMl
                    validators, and achecker. We wanted our website to be intuitive and easy to navigate, with the
                    correct
                    tags for screen-readers. We wanted buttons to be pressable and text to be readable, whilst staying
                    true
                    to our vision for a sophisticated hotel. Our approach to universal design was to have a clean
                    consistent
                    design through the pages. We deliberately used elements with a lot of activity to be paired with
                    spaces
                    of non-activity as to not overwhelm people with for example ADHD. For example, the gif of the
                    fireplace
                    in the index pages is surrounded by black and some short text, instead of bright colors and lots of
                    information. We tried to create a logical structure in the html and in the design whilst also making
                    the
                    website inviting and interesting. </p>
                <p>Due to the fact that we are still learning, it was difficult for us to implement some features of
                    universal design we would have liked to. Designing an elegant keyboard navigation system would have
                    been
                    ideal but out of our range of skills. We have no pop-ups or time-out features, but these would have
                    been
                    approached with the plan of conforming to AA standards. </p>

                <h2>Toptal Test</h2>
                <p>Due to the fact that all our headings are in white and our backgrounds are dark, important
                    information
                    was always readable (when checking all types of color-blindness), contrast was important to us from
                    the
                    beginning, and readability was an integral part of our design.</p>

                <p>Due to the fact that we only used one instance of script (flashing), we made sure that our automatic
                    slideshow changed images after every 4 seconds to ensure that it wouldn't cause seizures.</p>
